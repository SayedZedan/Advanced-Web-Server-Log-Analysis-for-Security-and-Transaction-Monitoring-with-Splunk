# Security-Incident-Reporting-and-Vulnerability-Detection-using-Splunk
In this project, I took on the role of a data analyst tasked with providing valuable insights to various users across a fictional company, SwitchCode Systems. My responsibilities included gathering and reporting data related to purchases made at the company, with a focus on identifying suspicious activities, particularly around failed transactions and credit card data. Through thorough analysis, I aimed to tell meaningful stories that could help users detect potential security issues and vulnerabilities within the organization.
